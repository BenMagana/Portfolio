## [Planet Nine](https://github.com/BenMagana/Portfolio/edit/main/Projects/Unity/PlanetNine)

Planet Nine is an original concept I'm working on, currently as the sole developer. Barotrauma and Space Haven were the inspiriation to the game concept.

The setting is a failed colinization attempt around the theorized [Planet Nine](https://github.com/BenMagana/Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Unity/PlanetNine). As a crew, players navitgate the surface, orbit, and free space around the planet in search of resources, weapons.

This is my first game project that hasn't followed a guide and that's progressed past the initial hack.

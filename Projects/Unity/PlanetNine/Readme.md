# Planet Nine

## concept
The setting is a failed colinization attempt around the theorized [Planet Nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Ninehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Nine). As a crew, players navitgate the surface, orbit, and free space around the planet in search of resources, weapons.

## Mechanics

### Movement
Localized grid movement and rotation. Movement in direction the player is looking. Camera movement is restricted to within a viable angle.

### Instantiation
The UI (placeholder) is created at runtime to allow dynamic inclusion of prefab objects. This makes it easy to add user-created prefabs after the project is compiled.
